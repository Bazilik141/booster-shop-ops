-- NCRM-02 follow-up
-- Grants required for the server-side Next.js repository layer to read/write
-- through Supabase PostgREST with SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY.
--
-- Intentionally not granting table/view access to anon here: the current app
-- does not query Supabase from browser components. Owner-facing auth/RLS can
-- add authenticated-role policies in a later NCRM task.
